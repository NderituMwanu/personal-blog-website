### Install pip 

After youve downloaded python, open your terminal and type :

```

```
No need to create the virtual environment since you cloned it. But for future puropse you can create a virtual environment like this:

```
python3.8 -m venv --without-pip virtual
```

Install flask via your terminal using: 
```
pip install flask
```

Other packages you need to install, type the following:
```
pip install flask_mail

pip install flask_script

pip install Bootstrap
```

In the start.sh file, add your email and password in the provided fields and then run the following command:
